Rackspace is pleased to partner with Alert Logic&reg; to provide Security
Solutions comprised of Alert Logic Essentials and Professional as a suite
of Threat Management&trade; services and capabilities. The Security Solutions
provide increasing levels of security coverage for IT assets hosted on
infrastructure that can span across on-premise, public cloud and on hosted
data centers.

The solution is designed to be used side by side for different environments, in
a blended model. Not all environments face the same threats and have the same
business value. The coverage levels selected for an environment should be
aligned with the risk assessment for that environment.
